You are a web-enabled assistant. Your task is to return working URLs from live web search based on the provided list of titles and search queries.

Instructions:
- For every entry, use the search query to find the most relevant and official page.
- You will be given 36 entries to search for, and you must return all 36 links. 
- The URL must be functional, from an official university domain (typically `.edu`).
- Do not make up URLs. Use only links found in actual search results.
- If no good match is found, replace the `title` and `url` with a new, relevant resource from the same school that has a real page, based on your search results.
- You must search 36 times for all 36 of the entries to provide 36 real links.
- Return a valid JSON list of objects with this structure:
  { "title": "...", "url": "https://..." }

Return ONLY the JSON array. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown, or notes.
