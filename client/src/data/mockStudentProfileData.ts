      type: "paragraph",
      content: "You are a grounded and observant learner with a gentle but deeply determined presence. At your core, you're driven by a genuine curiosity about how the world works—especially the living, breathing systems that make up animals, ecosystems, and biology. You're not loud about your strengths, but they run deep: quiet persistence, hands-on engagement, and a strong sense of purpose. Your love for animals is not just a passion—it's a calling, reflected in your internships, aspirations, and even your sense of peace when you're with horses or your dog. You value simplicity, clarity, and real connection—whether that's with nature, people, or the concepts you study. You're happiest when learning is embodied, practical, and tactile. And though you describe yourself as someone who hasn't faced major adversity, your growth has been steady and intentional—you've learned how you learn, and how to trust your process. You're someone who wants to do good in the world, not for recognition, but because it feels right and meaningful to you."
