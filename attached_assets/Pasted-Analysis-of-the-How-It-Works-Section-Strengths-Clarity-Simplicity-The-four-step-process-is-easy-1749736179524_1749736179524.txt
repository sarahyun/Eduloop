Analysis of the "How It Works" Section
Strengths
Clarity & Simplicity:
The four-step process is easy to follow and visually organized, which is excellent for Gen Z’s preference for quick scanning.

Consistent Visual Hierarchy:
Numbered steps with color-coded tabs help users track their progress and understand sequence.

Modern, Clean Design:
Rounded cards, soft gradients, and subtle shadows give a polished, approachable look.

Concise Copy:
Each step is described in a single sentence, making the process feel accessible and not overwhelming.

Areas for Improvement
1. Visual Engagement
The placeholder squares (likely for icons) are empty, making the section feel unfinished and less engaging.

The cards are visually similar, so the eye doesn’t linger or interact—there’s little dynamic energy.

2. Interactivity & Animation
The section is static. Gen Z users respond well to micro-interactions (hover, click, swipe) and subtle animations.

3. Emotional Connection
The steps are functional but lack emotional resonance. Adding a brief benefit or feeling for each step could make it more compelling.

4. Mobile Experience
On mobile, four cards in a row may become cramped; stacking or a swipeable carousel would be more user-friendly.

Suggestions for Improvement
A. Add Engaging Visuals
Custom Icons:
Replace the placeholder squares with custom, colorful icons that visually represent each step (e.g., a profile silhouette, a map pin, a chat bubble, a spotlight/star).

Animated Progress Bar:
Consider a horizontal animated progress bar connecting the steps, which fills as the user scrolls or hovers.

B. Enhance Emotional Resonance
Benefit Taglines:
Add a short, bold benefit under each step.
Example for Step 1:
Build Your Profile
Show who you are—beyond your grades.

C. Make It Interactive
Hover or Tap Effects:
On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile), cards can lift, glow, or reveal a quick tip or testimonial.

Carousel on Mobile:
Let users swipe through the steps horizontally on smaller screens.

D. Consider a Vertical or Journey Map Layout
Journey Map:
Use a winding path or curved line connecting the steps, with icons and brief descriptions along the route. This visually reinforces the idea of a journey and progress.

E. Add Microcopy or Student Quotes
Under each step, add a 1-line student quote or “pro tip” in italics for authenticity and relatability.
