our current section is visually clean and organized, but the wording and content can be made more subtle, authentic, and engaging for Gen Z. Here’s a critique and a set of improvements based on best practices for Gen Z-focused education marketing:

Critique
What’s Working:

The toggle between “Find Your Fit” and “Acceptance Advantage” is interactive and clear.

Icons and color-coded cards add visual interest and help with scanning.

The layout is uncluttered and mobile-friendly.

What Could Be Improved:

The copy is still a bit “on-the-nose” and reads like marketing bullet points rather than something a student would say or feel.

Phrases like “Where you’ll actually be happy” and “How to actually get in” sound a little forced and less sophisticated.

The benefits are generic and don’t always feel personal or differentiated.

There’s an opportunity to add more voice, authenticity, and emotional resonance—qualities Gen Z craves in brand messaging.

Suggestions for Subtle, Engaging Wording
Section Headings
Current: “Where you’ll actually be happy” / “How to actually get in”

Try:

“Find your place, your people, your path”

“Make your application feel real—and get noticed”

Benefit Cards: More Subtle, Conversational, and Relatable
Acceptance Advantage
Authentic Fit Stories → “Show colleges who you really are”

Share what matters to you, not just what’s on your resume.

School-Specific Strategies → “Tips tailored to each school”

Every college is different. We help you speak their language.

Higher Success Rates → “Apply where you’ll thrive”

Focus on places where you’re more than a number.

Scholarship Opportunities → “See real financial options”

Find scholarships and aid that actually fit your story.

Find Your Fit
Perfect Personality Match → “Colleges that just feel right”

Find schools that vibe with your style, not just your stats.

Goal-Aligned Programs → “Programs that fit your interests”

Explore majors and paths you’ll actually want to pursue.

Thriving Campus Culture → “Communities you click with”

See where you’ll find your people, not just a place to study.

Hidden Gem Discovery → “Unexpected options, just for you”

Get matched with schools you might not have found on your own.

Additional Engagement Tips
Add a micro-interaction: When a user toggles between “Find Your Fit” and “Acceptance Advantage,” animate the cards sliding or fading in for a modern, dynamic feel.

Use a short, real student quote under each toggle or card, e.g.,

“I never thought I’d find a campus that actually felt like home.”

Consider swapping icons for real student or campus photos for more authenticity (even if subtly in the background).

Example: Redesigned Content
Toggle:
[Find Your Fit] [Acceptance Advantage]

Why This Works
More subtle, less salesy: The benefits are phrased as outcomes or experiences, not features.

Conversational: Feels like a peer or older sibling is giving advice, not a brand.

Authentic: Avoids hype, focuses on real student goals and anxieties.

Visually engaging: The toggle and card layout are interactive, and you can further enhance with micro-animations or subtle background imagery.

In summary:
Make the copy more conversational and outcome-focused, add a touch of real student voice, and keep the visuals interactive but not overwhelming. This will resonate much more with Gen Z’s desire for authenticity, subtlety, and real connection.
