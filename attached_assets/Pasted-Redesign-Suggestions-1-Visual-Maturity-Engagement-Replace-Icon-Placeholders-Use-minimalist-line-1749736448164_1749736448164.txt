Redesign Suggestions
1. Visual Maturity & Engagement
Replace Icon Placeholders:
Use minimalist, line-style icons that are visually distinct for each step (e.g., a profile silhouette, a map pin, a chat bubble, a spotlight). Keep them monochrome or muted for sophistication.

Journey Map or Vertical Timeline:
Consider a vertical or winding journey map layout, or a staggered horizontal timeline, to visually suggest progress and growth.

Reduce Card Roundness:
Slightly sharper corners or less pronounced rounding will make the cards feel less toy-like.

Micro-Interactions:
Subtle hover effects (e.g., card lift, icon color shift) can add interactivity without feeling childish.

2. Copy Tone: Subtle, Mature, Authentic
Keep it straightforward, avoid hype.
Use language that feels like a peer or older sibling, not a marketer.

How It Works
Step-by-step support for your college journey

1. Build Your Profile
[Profile Icon]
Share your interests, values, and goals—beyond grades.

2. Get Matched
[Map/Compass Icon]
See schools that align with your strengths and what matters to you.

3. AI Mentor Chat
[Chat Bubble Icon]
Ask questions, get advice, and brainstorm essays—on your schedule.

4. Stand Out in Applications
[Spotlight Icon]
Get tailored, school-specific tips to help your application reflect who you are.

Optional: Add a Quiet Confidence Statement Below
“You know yourself best. We help colleges see that, too.”

3. Student Voice: Subtle, Not Forced
If you want to include student feedback, use a simple, direct quote:

“I discovered colleges that actually fit me.”

“The advice was practical and easy to act on.”

4. Mobile Experience
On mobile, stack cards vertically with icons left-aligned and plenty of white space. Consider a swipeable carousel for each step.

5. Color Palette
Use slightly deeper or more neutral background shades for the section to add seriousness (e.g., light slate, muted lavender).

Keep accent colors for icons and step numbers, but avoid overly pastel backgrounds.
