WHY IT’S HARDER THAN EVER
The Challenge

Record Competition:
8.5 million+ applications last year. Acceptance rates are at historic lows.

Beyond Grades:
Schools want your story, your interests, your real fit—not just your stats.

High Stakes, High Stress:
Most students say this feels like the biggest decision of their lives.

WHAT STUDENTS FEEL
“I’m overwhelmed by choices and don’t know where to start.”
“I feel like just a number, not a person.”
“I want to find my people, but how do I know where I’ll fit in?”
“What if I miss out on opportunities I don’t even know exist?”

AI Counselor Demo

Student:
"I honestly have no idea what I want to major in. Everyone keeps asking and I just freeze. I like math, but I also want to travel. My parents think I should do business or engineering, but that doesn’t really feel right."

AI Counselor:
"That’s more common than you think. Most students change majors anyway. Let’s look at what excites you, not just what’s expected. Since you mentioned math and travel, here are a few paths you might want to check out…"

Middlebury College – International Economics (study abroad, quantitative focus)

Colorado College – Environmental Science (field research, data analysis)

Northeastern – Business + Co-op (real work experience in different cities)
