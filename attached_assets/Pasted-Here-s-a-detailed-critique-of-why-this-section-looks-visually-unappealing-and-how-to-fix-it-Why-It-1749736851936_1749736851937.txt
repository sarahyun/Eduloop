Here’s a detailed critique of why this section looks visually unappealing—and how to fix it:

Why It Looks “Ugly”
1. Flat, Monotonous Gradient
The purple/blue gradient is heavy, lacks subtlety, and covers a large area without any visual break. It feels dated and overwhelming, rather than modern or dynamic.

2. Poor Visual Hierarchy
The quote and the CTA section are both large, bold, and centered, but there’s no clear separation or flow between them. They visually compete for attention rather than guiding the eye.

The text sizes are similar, making it hard to distinguish the quote from the CTA headline.

3. Lack of Visual Interest
There are no icons, images, or illustrations—just blocks of text. This creates a “wall of words” effect.

The section feels empty and generic, lacking personality or warmth.

4. Button Design Issues
The buttons are large and pill-shaped, but their colors are too similar to the background, reducing contrast and clickability.

The secondary button (“See How It Works”) is washed out and hard to read.

5. Spacing and Alignment
There’s too much vertical space between elements, making the section feel disjointed.

The alignment is very centered and static, giving a “template” feel rather than a designed experience.

How to Improve It
1. Refine the Gradient or Use a Subtle Background
Use a softer, more nuanced gradient, or break up the background with a subtle pattern, texture, or abstract shape.

Consider a white or very light background for the CTA section to create contrast with the quote above.

2. Improve Hierarchy & Flow
Make the quote smaller, italicized, or use a lighter font weight to set it apart from the CTA.

Add a visual separator (like a thin line or soft shadow) between the quote and the CTA.

3. Add Visual Elements
Include a small, relevant icon or illustration next to the quote or CTA headline for personality.

Consider adding a photo of a real student or a subtle abstract illustration to break up the text.

4. Enhance Button Design
Use a high-contrast color for the primary button (e.g., white with bold text, or a vibrant accent).

Make the secondary button outline more visible, or use a different style (like a ghost button).

5. Tighten Spacing and Alignment
Reduce vertical padding between elements.

Consider left-aligning the quote or CTA for a more modern feel.

Make sure the buttons are closer to the supporting text and not floating in space.

Example Redesign (Description)
Top:
“When you apply to schools that truly fit you, your applications become authentic and compelling—not generic. That’s what gets you noticed—and gets you in.”
(smaller, italic, with a quote icon)

Divider:
A thin, subtle line or shadow.

CTA Block (on white or lighter background):
Ready to Crush Your College Applications?
Get guidance that understands you—and a strategy that gets you in.
[Find My College Match] [See How It Works]
(Primary button in a bold accent color, secondary button with clear outline)

Optional:
Add a small illustration or student photo to the side or behind the CTA for warmth and authenticity.

In summary:
The current section is visually flat, lacks hierarchy, and feels generic. Add separation, visual interest, and better contrast—while tightening spacing and using icons or images—to create a more inviting, modern, and effective CTA section.
